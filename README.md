# WPI CS2223-B23 - Algorithms

This repository serves as my personal archive of all projects done for the Algorithms course at WPI.
As a general note, I will be using Java v16 for all projects unless otherwise specified.

## Folder Structure
Within these folders, a separate README will exist with more detailed requirements and explanations.
- `HW1`: Mathematical number game Nim.
    - Solved using simple bitwise operations.

- `HW2`: Numerical series calculations and Subirachs Square.
    - Uses simple recursion for the Numerical Series
    - Calculates the PowerSet and sums every subset to calculate  

- `HW3`: Palindromes, Inversions, and Binary Reflected Gray Codes (BRGCs) files.
    - Palindromes - Recursively calls a substring function until the beginning and end are not the same, or the length is =< 1
    - Inversions - Uses sorting algorithms to detect the number of inversions in the 
    - BRGCs - Uses a binary number generation algorithm to create a PowerSet.

- `HW4`: Gauss-Jordan Elimination & Dynamic Programming
    - Uses the  Gauss-Jordan Elimination technique to solve a 2d matrix. 
    - A greedy backtrack algorithm to find an optimal path in a 2d matrix.

- `HW5`: Closed Hashing and Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Using a Closed Hashing/Open Addressing algorithm, hashes `./txts/Moby-Dick-Chapter-1-groomed.txt` into a 997-length table.
    - Prompts the user to enter the beginning and end location they wish to travel between on a hardcoded weighted graph and find the shortest path.

- `HW6`: Backtracking and the N-Queens Problem
    -
