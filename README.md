# WPI CS2223-B23 - Algorithms

This repository serves as my personal archive of all projects done for the Algorithms course at WPI.
As a general note, I will be using Java v16 for all projects unless otherwise specified.

## Folder Structure
Within these folders, a seperate README will exist with more detailed requirements and explinations.
- `HW1`: Mathmatical number game Nim.
    - Solved using simple bitwise opperations.

- `HW2`: Numerical series calculations and Subirachs Square.
    - Uses simple recursion for the Numerical Series
    - Calculates the PowerSet and sums every subset to calculate  

- `HW3`: Palindromes, Inversions, and Binary Reflected Gray Codes (BRGCs) files.
    - Palindromes - Recursively calls a substring function until the beginning and end are not the same, or the length is =< 1
    - Inversions - Uses sorting algorithms to detect the ammount of inversions in the 
    - BRGCs - Uses a binary number generation algorithm to create a PowerSet.

- `HW4`: Gauss-Jordan Elimination & Dynamic Programming
    - 

- `HW5`:
    - 

- `HW6`: Backtracking and the N-Queens Problem
    -
