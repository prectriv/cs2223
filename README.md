## WPI CS2223-B23 - Algorithms

This repository serves as my personal archive of all projects done for the algorithms course at WPI.
As a general note, I will be using Java v16 for all projects.

## Folder Structure

Within these folders, a seperate README will exist with more detailed requirements and explinations.
- `HW1_Nim`: This folder contains all files dedicated to the mathmatical number game Nim.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
