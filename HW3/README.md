# HW3 - Palindromes, Inversions (Sorting Algorithms), and BRGC
## P1) `./PalindromeCheck`
- Checks if a string of any length is a palindrome
- Filters any non-alphabetical character out of the string with regex
- Reccursively substrings(1, length - 1) until reaches 0 or a non equivilent 0 and length - 1 position

## P2) `./Inversions/App.java`
- Checks how many inversions are in a least-to-greatest list
> [Note!]
> Ex) (3, 2, 1) => (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1) = 3 inversions

## P3) `./AlgoRhythmics`
- This is a BRGC algorithm that makes every possible subset of a fictitious music group.
